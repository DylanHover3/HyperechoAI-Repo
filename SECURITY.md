# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the HyperEcho AI website and provides guidance for maintaining security best practices.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)

The website implements a strict Content Security Policy to prevent XSS attacks and other code injection vulnerabilities:

- **script-src**: Limited to self and trusted domains (Google Analytics, Cal.com, Disqus)
- **style-src**: Self and Google Fonts with 'unsafe-inline' for critical CSS
- **img-src**: Restricted to self, data URIs, and necessary third-party domains
- **connect-src**: Limited to self and required external APIs
- **frame-src**: Only allows Cal.com and Disqus embeds

### 2. Form Security

#### Webhook URL Protection
- Webhook URLs are stored in configuration files rather than hardcoded in JavaScript
- URLs are passed to client-side scripts via data attributes
- Consider using environment variables in production deployments

#### Input Validation
- Client-side validation for required fields and email format
- Basic input sanitization to prevent HTML injection
- Server-side validation should be implemented on the webhook endpoint

#### Error Handling
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Reduced information disclosure in error messages
- Logging of errors for debugging while protecting sensitive information

### 3. Third-Party Integration Security

#### Cal.com Embed
- Enhanced error handling and fallback messaging
- Timeout protection for script loading
- Conditional loading only on relevant pages

#### External Scripts
- CrossOrigin attributes for external script loading
- Error handling for failed script loads
- Consideration for Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes where possible

### 4. Additional Security Headers

- **X-Frame-Options**: SAMEORIGIN to prevent clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff to prevent MIME-type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: strict-origin-when-cross-origin for privacy

## Security Best Practices

### For Development

1. **Never commit sensitive data** like API keys, passwords, or private URLs to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration in production
3. **Regularly update dependencies** to patch security vulnerabilities
4. **Test security headers** using tools like SecurityHeaders.com
5. **Validate all input** both client-side and server-side

### For Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
2. **Implement rate limiting** on webhook endpoints to prevent abuse
3. **Monitor webhook usage** for suspicious activity
4. **Regularly audit** third-party integrations and their permissions
5. **Consider implementing** CSRF protection for sensitive operations

### For Content Management

1. **Sanitize all user-generated content** before display
2. **Validate file uploads** if implemented in the future
3. **Use secure authentication** for admin areas
4. **Regularly backup** data and configuration

## Webhook Security Considerations

The current webhook integration sends form data to Make.com. Consider:

1. **Implementing rate limiting** on the webhook endpoint
2. **Adding webhook authentication** (signatures, tokens)
3. **Monitoring for abuse** and suspicious submissions
4. **Data retention policies** for submitted form data
5. **GDPR compliance** for user data handling

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Contact** the development team directly via email
3. **Provide** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Allow time** for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure
